# dynnet

dynnet provides a set of latent space models for static and dynamic
networks. Currently, the package provides the original Euclidean model of Hoff,
Raftery, & Handcock (HRH; 2002) along with a variation of the model that uses
reference nodes as a method of parameter identification. Extensions to the
Projection Model and dynamic networks are planned for the near future.

*This is currently experimental software. You have been warned.*
