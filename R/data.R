##' Informal communication within a sawmill on strike.
##'
##' This undirected network contains the informal communication network between
##' 24 striking sawmill workers (Michael 1997). See Details below.
##'
##' The source link provides this description of the data:
##'
##' ``In a wood-processing facility, a new management team proposed changes to the
##' workers' compensation package, which the workers did not accept. They
##' started a strike, which led to a negotiation stalemate. Then, management
##' asked an outsider to analyze the communication structure among the employees
##' because it felt that information about the proposed changes was not
##' effectively communicated to all employees by the union negotiators.
##'
##' The outside consultant asked all employees to indicate the frequency in
##' which they discussed the strike with each of their colleagues on a 5-point
##' scale, ranging from `almost never' (less then once per week) to `very often'
##' (several times per day). The consultant used three as a cut-off value. If at
##' least one of two persons indicated that they discussed work with a frequency
##' of three or more, a line between them was added to the informal
##' communication network.
##'
##' The network displays fairly stringent demarcations between groups defined on
##' age and language. The Spanish-speaking young employees, who are of age 30 or
##' younger, are almost disconnected from the English- speaking young employees,
##' who communicate with no more than two of the older English-speaking
##' employees.
##'
##' All ties between groups have special backgrounds. Among the Hispanics,
##' Alejandro is most proficient in English and Bob speaks some Spanish, which
##' explains their tie. Bob owes Norm for getting his job and probably because
##' of this, they developed a friendship tie. Finally, Ozzie is the father of
##' Karl.''
